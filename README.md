# CodeQuiz

## Description

This repository hosts a code quiz. You will have 30 seconds upon hitting the start button to take the quiz where you will be asked 5 questions pertaining to JavaScript. If you select the correct answer you will receive 20 points. Selecting the wrong answer will reduce the time you have to complete the quiz by 10 seconds making it possible for you to fail without completing all the questions. 

Upon completing the quiz or when the timer hits 0 you will be taken to a highscore page where you can input your initials and your score. Both of which will be saved to your localstorage for you to keep.
